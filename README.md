# Bus-Reservation-System
This is a simple Bus Reservation System built in Java without using any databases (JDBC). The system allows users to book seats on a bus, check bus availability, and manage bookings.

Key Features:
Bus Information: The system displays bus details such as bus number, whether the bus is air-conditioned (AC), total capacity, and available seats.

Booking System: Users can enter their name, select a bus by its number, and choose a travel date to make a booking.

Seat Availability Check: Before confirming a booking, the system checks if seats are available on the selected bus for the given date.

Capacity Management: The bus's available capacity is updated automatically after each confirmed booking.

Simple Input: The system takes user input through the console for ease of use.

This project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), collections (ArrayList), and handling user input using the Scanner class.
